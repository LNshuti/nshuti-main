Salut!
I'm a Data Engineer at [UBS](https://ubs.com).

Previously I was a Statistician at [Vanderbilt University Medical Center](https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/welcome-health-policy) and [Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/).

I love reading historical fiction, and writing python code. I'm currently reading [Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland](https://www.amazon.com/Say-Nothing-Murder-Northern-Ireland/dp/0385521316) by Patrick Radden. Keefe.
