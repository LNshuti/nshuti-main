Hey, I'm a Data Engineer at [UBS](https://ubs.com).

Previously I was a Statistician at [Vanderbilt University Medical Center](https://better.com) and [Harvard University](https://glean.ai).

I love reading historical fiction, and writing python code. I'm currently reading [Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland] (https://www.amazon.com/Say-Nothing-Murder-Northern-Ireland/dp/0385521316) by Patrick Radden. Keefe.
